AEA LaTeX Style and Supporting Files: Installation Instructions
===============================================================

This distribution is for users of latex who do not expect to share files with
Scientific Word/Workplace (SW) users or to use SW. 

If you use SW, you should download this distribution:
http://www.aeaweb.org/templates/sw_templates.zip

If you do not use SW, but you anticipate sharing files with SW users, you should 
download this distribution:
http://www.aeaweb.org/templates/latex_sw-supported_templates.zip

The present distribution (http://www.aeaweb.org/templates/latex_templates.zip)
should contain these files:

aea.bst
AEA.cls
AEA-LaTeX-AuthorInstructions.pdf 
AEA-LaTeX-StyleInstallation.txt (this file)
AEJ-Article.tex
AER-Article.tex
JEL-Article.tex
PP-Article.tex
multicol.sty
setspace.sty
natbib.pdf
natnotes.pdf
harvard.pdf

Installation Instructions:
-------------------------

1. Place AEA.cls in your TEXINPUTS path. 

   For miktex this should be something like: <MiKTeX Home>\texmf\tex\latex\AEA\
   where <MiKTeX Home> is wherever miktex is installed and you will most likely
   have to create the AEA directory if you have not done so before.
   
   If you are unsure where to place this file, try placing it in the same 
   subdirectory tree as other *.cls files which are known to be properly installed
   on your system.

2. The multicol and setspace packages are used by the AEA style. 

   You should already have multicol.sty as part of your latex installation. 
   
   If your tex installation uses a package manager, please install setspace from 
   the package manager. For miktex users, the package manager is here:
   Start Menu > Miktex > Maintenance (Admin) > Package Manager (Admin)
   
   For Miktex Package Manager: 
   Type setspace in the "name" box and click the "filter" button and right-click
   on the setspace package entry for an install option, if the package is not installed.
   
   If you don't have a package manager, install the following files to your 
   TEXINPUTS path if they are not already present (do not install multiple copies):
   multicol.sty
   setspace.sty
   
3. If you will be using BibTeX we recommend that you use either the natbib package
   or the harvard package to support a wider variety of citation commands. 
   
   If you have a package manager, please install one of these from your package
   manager. If you don't have a package manager, natbib is available here:
   http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/natbib
   and harvard is available here:
   http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/harvard
   
   For your convenience, the following documentation is included for these packages:
      natbib.pdf
      natnotes.pdf
      harvard.pdf

4. Place aea.bst with your bibTeX styles, if you use bibTeX. Make sure to remove 
   or rename all other older versions of any files called aea.bst from any input 
   paths to avoid the wrong style being accidentally used. 
   
   Note that this version of aea.bst places a comment with version number at the 
   top of the bbl file (Bibstyle aea.bst version 2009.05.20) so that you can 
   confirm that the correct version of aea.bst is being used. If you
   do not see this message at the top of your newly-created bbl files, then you 
   should rename or remove all old copies of aea.bst and install the copy included 
   in this distribution.
   
   The bibstyle AER.bst is not supported. Please use aea.bst instead.

5. Miktex users may need to refresh the filename database. This is found in the
   Start Menu > Miktex > Maintenance (Admin) > Settings (Admin) > General Tab:
   Click the Refresh FNDB button. Failure to find AEA.cls means either the file
   is misplaced (in a directory where TeX is not looking) or the filename database 
   was not refreshed.

6. The supplied *.tex files may be used as templates to prepare your article. There
   is a specific template for each journal:
      AER-Article.tex: The American Economic Review
      PP-Article.tex:  Papers and Proceedings
      JEL-Article.tex: Journal of Economic Literature
      AEJ-Article.tex: American Economics Journal
   To use one of these files as a template, make a copy of the supplied tex file, 
   rename it, and edit it in your prefered text editor.

7. The document class provides these class options:
   Journal selection:
      AER: The American Economic Review
      PP:  Papers and Proceedings
      JEL: Journal of Economic Literature
      AEJ: American Economics Journal
   Typesetting mode selection:
      finalmode:  to typeset the manuscript for submission for publication
      reviewmode: to typeset a review copy
      draftmode:  to typeset a draft copy with 1.5-line spacing 
                  (or your own choice of spacing); journal name doesn't appear in head

Example usage: review copy for AER: \documentclass[AER,reviewmode]{AEA}
				  
8. Review the Instructions to Authors in the file AEA-LaTeX-AuthorInstructions.pdf.

9. Note that we have some new environments (figurenotes, JEL, Keywords). 
   If you collaborate with an author who does not have a recent version of 
   the style then please either provide them with a copy of your AEA.cls or 
   have them update from the AEA website if they receive a latex compile error 
   suggesting that one of these environments is undefined. 
     
Further Assistance:
------------------

* MikTeX documentation can be found here: http://miktex.org/docs

* TeXLive documentation can be found here: http://www.tug.org/texlive/doc.html
  
* MikTeX and Mathtime: miktex configures the mathtime package, by default, for
  use with commercial fonts which you probably don't have. If you get a compile-time
  error regarding missing fonts (mtex.pfb, mtsy.pfb, or rmtmi.pfb) then see our 
  technical support page at http://www.aeaweb.org/templates/technical_support.pdf
  Alternatively, if you are not submitting to P&P, you may simply remove the mathtime
  package.

* If you are still experiencing difficulties, please see our technical support page at 
  http://www.aeaweb.org/templates/technical_support.pdf or send email to aeraccept@aeapubs.org.
